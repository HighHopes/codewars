"""Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

DNA_strand ("ATTGC") # return "TAACG"

DNA_strand ("GTAT") # return "CATA"""

	new_dna = ""
	for i in [i for i in dna]:

			new_dna += "T"

		elif i == "C":
			new_dna += "G"
		else:
			new_dna += "C"
